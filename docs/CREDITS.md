# Credits and licenses

[← Documentation](README.md)

This project is licensed under the **GNU GPL v2 or later** ([LICENSE](../LICENSE)), like the
project it is based on.

## Based on

- [**deadinside28/bloodborne_pc**](https://github.com/deadinside28/bloodborne_pc) (bbport) by
  deadinside28: the native Linux port this project started from as a fork, and a separate
  repository since October 2026. Its releases are merged here as they come out (now **0.5**), with
  their history; the merge commits name each one. It provides the loader, the PS4 runtime, the
  renderer extensions, the upscalers, the game-specific fixes and the original launcher. Code
  taken from it keeps its authorship in the git history.
- [**shadPS4**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4): the video core and shader recompiler
  (GPL-2.0+), and [sirit](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/sirit).

## From other forks

Changes taken from other ports of bbport, with thanks:

- [**bmy/bbport-mac**](https://github.com/bmy/bbport-mac) (Rosetta 2 port of bbport to macOS):
  - the Retina-resolution window (`gpu/shim/window.cpp`, `BB_RETINA`);
  - the texture cache hashing whole images when checking a possibly changed one (the item
    picture on the loading screen).
